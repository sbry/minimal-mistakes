The cleanest sheet of them all goes to Mr. Morinho. Without a doubt
the greatest trainer ever. And I do not say it lightly. You cannot
make this up and I happily quote wikipedia, about
[Unbeaten home league record
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho#Unbeaten_home_league_record)
in detail:

> Between 23 February 2002 and 2 April 2011, Mourinho went 150 home league matches unbeaten: 38 (W36–D2) with Porto, 60 (W46–D14) with Chelsea, 38 (W29–D9) with Inter Milan and 14 (W14–D0) with Real Madrid. The run was broken by Sporting de Gijón on 2 April 2011, when they defeated Real Madrid 1–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in La Liga. After the match, Mourinho entered Gijón's dressing room and congratulated them.[208] His only prior home league defeat had come when Porto lost 3–2 to Beira-Mar on 23 February 2002.

But the worst has yet to come. There is a [Second unbeaten home league record
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho#Second_unbeaten_home_league_record):

>Mourinho underwent a 45 home league matches unbeaten streak: 31
>(W27–D4) with Real Madrid and 14 (W13–D1) with Chelsea. This streak
>was ended on 19 April 2014, when Chelsea lost 2–1 to Sunderland.[211]
>This defeat also ended Mourinho's two spell 77-game unbeaten Premier
>League unbeaten sequence at Stamford Bridge.

And now this Boxing Day Morinho's Manchester United played Sunderland
at home. MU as [livetv.tu](a sports channel on the internet)
subtitled. Scoring one of the greatest goals of world history and now
yesterday a certain Firmino at Anfield Stadium did the same for Liverpool.
