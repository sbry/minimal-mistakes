title: "the first post is the hardest"

After a long time I want to continue to write down stuff I do or think about. Next time there is a chance it is here. Also I really like the speed of Git and Github and it might be fun to apply this to hosting. 

Today is the day I decided on how to begin developing react and there are several application that just wait to be written. After trying several boilerplates from this [Github Search](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=react+boilerplate&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93)[^1] I finally settled on the sensible `npm install -g create-react-app` from [I guess faceboook](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It works great and there is no [wizard code I dont understand](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/wizards). But seriously 

```
justin@tsoff ~/workspace> du -sch pt-react 
141M	pt-react
141M	insgesamt
```

141M for an empty clone of hello world seems excessive. But node is famous for this and I really like hot-reload and the actual build is only 2M. In fact `atom` makes my old Athlon freeze and [jsx-mode](https://github.com/jsx/jsx-mode.el) is beyond me for now. And talking of performance this [Fork of Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) takes like an hour to build and the development server takes 10s to start. So that is that.

And now: good luck committing this and good luck to github building it.
