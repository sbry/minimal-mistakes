A new dawn has come (the weather in Berlin is seriously improved by the impending doom of mankind [timeline @xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1732/)) and thoughts so far were on grading children in school (if at all then as late as possible), and I will make a beautiful argument in the course of the day. Second subject has been bicycle navigation and the power of google even in this slightly arcane area. And beyond usability there are better routes and better maps, but it wont work offline, where is the niche, where is the opportunity. This might be a global thing, devloping stuff like this offline has a different revenue-model: subscription and premium. But now over to the react-project of yesterday.



## About Grades ##

As with every argument ever the pro and con can be turned around easily with the common trick: bad things are "training" for future bad things, good things weaken. Obviously this argument does not work for all humans, because some of the damage doing training (for example marines) is neurosis[^1], which will be harmful to the neurotic and dangerous for the victims. Doing a harmful thing to get people ready for future harmful things is not convincing.

Now why are grades harmful? They take the fun out of learning, they reduce the human, the are in fact biased and antisocial and Denmark stopped using them years ago.

And from a higher perspective Grades are are way for the capital (or the soldier king) to assess the subjects easily and select those to employ, over those to die miserably on their usefulness. Grades this way perpetuate the fatal status quo. 

[^1]: Hard to say if fat people are neurotic about food, I guess.
