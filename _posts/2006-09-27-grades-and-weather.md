A new dawn has come (the weather in Berlin is seriously improved by the impending doom of mankind [timeline @xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1732/)) and thoughts so far were on grading children in school (if at all then as late as possible), and here is an meta-argument. 

With every other argument ever the pro and con can be turned around easily with tricks: bad things are "training" for future bad things, good things weaken. I one is out of cash one has no money yet, I one has cash then not much longer, or forever. I wonder if anybody knows.

Now why are grades harmful? They take the fun out of learning, they reduce the human, the are in fact biased and antisocial and Denmark stopped using them years ago.

And from a higher perspective Grades are are way for the capital (or the soldier king) to assess the subjects easily and select those to employ, over those to die miserably on their uselessness. Grades this way perpetuate the fatal status quo. 

Well it turns out the grades are quite important to some and the whole thing is neither over nor unembarassing. An important question to some of the electants was for how long does this ruling apply. And everybody always (at least that I know) constantly repeated the mantra that the election results would be binding for two years, the total remaining time with this teacher. And even that evening some people questioned factuality and wisdom of this and quoted a school-law saying otherwise from their internet enabled tabled. Someone else refuted this with their internet enabled phone and I said to my neighbor: "My fax is stronger than your phone". There had been a 20 page text sent around before and I read to page 10 because then began the "appendix".  It turns out the appendix included the text of the law and some had read, some not. I not. 

But even better, after the meeting someone found the law in the appendix and misread, because it was confusing, then convinced several other people that the reading of the election for two years w/ or w/o numerical grades, and it was so convincing that when the lady with the smartphone answered via email, that the clause referencing §19 (2) in §19 (5) or something (she did not go into details), in fact did not apply to classes that are composed of two age-years of the children, so called JÜL or Flex-classes which at this point have been mostly but not entirely eliminated. For example it is the second year w/o flex for us, but there still are some making the law hard to read. I guess. But I would not be surprised if I was wrong about this a third time, **that** never happened before. But I have flip-flopped twice in a very short period before. Now I have finally met some others, who have shared the experience. I think this kind of experience is healthy and gives some perspective on the concept of absolute truth, or any truth possibly.
